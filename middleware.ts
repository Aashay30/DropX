/*
Parameter explanations:

- auth (function): Used to get the current user's authentication/session info. Returns a promise that resolves to an object with userId and other session data.
- request (NextRequest): The incoming HTTP request object from Next.js middleware.

Key functions:

- clerkMiddleware: Wraps your middleware to provide Clerk authentication context.
- createRouteMatcher: Returns a function that checks if a request matches any of the provided route patterns.
- auth.protect(): Ensures the route is protected. If the user is not authenticated, it redirects (for browser requests) or returns 401 (for API requests).

Summary of flow:

1. Check if the route is public.
2. If user is logged in and tries to access a public route (except "/"), redirect to "/dashboard".
3. If the route is not public, enforce authentication with auth.protect().
4. The matcher ensures this middleware only runs for relevant routes.

/* 

ðŸ§  Bonus: What is auth.protect()?
It:

Verifies a valid session

If session is invalid:

Automatically redirects (in browser)

Or returns 401 Unauthorized (for API routes)

Useful in middleware because itâ€™s universal for all routes
