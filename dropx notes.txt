to know the SQL , relations , keep things online

user given facade that we are inside a folder

only one schema --> self relationships ** VIMP **

clerk for auth --> with no branding
heroui for ui
image kit for handling the images --> restrict files types to be uploaded
neon postgres for database
drizzle as ORM (Object Relational Mapping) --> schemaas , relations , 
latest nextjs --> security by middleware in nextjs 
zod --> page validation library

1. npx create-next-app@latest .

full stack app :
auth -> clerk
business logic -> store info -> design schema -> 
storage -> imagekit

on backend we use ORM (drizzle here) to interact with DB (postgresql -- > neon)
